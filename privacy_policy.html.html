      <li>Messages sent to the bot</li>
      <li>Basic user profile information (e.g., name, username) that is necessary for the bot to function</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>The information collected by the "Test Bot" is used solely for testing and development purposes, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Responding to messages and interacting with users during the test</li>
      <li>Improving the botâ€™s functionality based on user interactions</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not sell, share, or distribute this information to third parties.</p>

    <h2>3. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We are committed to ensuring that your information is secure. We have put in place appropriate technical measures
      to safeguard the information collected during testing. However, this bot is used in a development environment and
      is not intended for public or long-term use.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Retention of Data</h2>
    <p>
      Any data collected by the "Test Bot" during testing will be stored for the duration of the test and may be deleted
      after the testing phase concludes.
    </p>
